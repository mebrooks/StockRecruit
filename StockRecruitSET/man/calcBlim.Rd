\title{Calculate Blim in ways described by ICES Advice Technical Guidelines Table 12.4.3.1.3}
\usage{
calcBlim(S, R, quant = 0.75, type = 2.1, g = 0.1, by = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{S}{vector of spawning stock biomasses}

\item{R}{vector of recruitment values}

\item{quant}{quantile above which recruitment is considered to be "large" in a "spasmodic stock" (language from ICES Advice Technical Guidelines)}

\item{type}{way of calculating Blim.
1 is the minimum S that gives good recruitment.
2 is the estimated S for a breakpoint in a hockey stick model.
2.1 is estimated S for inflection point in a hyperbolic hockey-stick model.
5 is the minimum observed S (Blim=Bloss).}

\item{g}{is the assumed smoothing parameter in the hyperbolic hockey-stick model.}

\item{by}{the precision needed for a grid search for breakpoint in a hockey-stick model. If missing, 100 points from min to max SSB are tried.}
